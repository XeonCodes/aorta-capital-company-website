                When quizzed during a speech in his most recent national tour,
                Obasanjo, Nigerian past president, made an intriguing statement
                that offers great insight about his journey on how he rose to
                become the president of Nigeria from a lowly, impoverished farm
                boy in Ogun state, Nigeria.

                To Obasanjo and his contemporaries in their time, the army was
                the even ground providence provided. It was the even ground that
                erased and removed all societal and aristocratic blockades set
                in place to frustrate and keep the ordinary man ordinary. The
                army was what provided an even ground for their generation to
                play on. An even ground where what mattered was abilities and
                capabilities; not statuses and connections.
